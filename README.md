### PoliTweets

### Pitch

PoliTweets provides greater visibility into nationally trending hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter or #IStandWithAhmed by breaking down the prevalence or scarcity of one or more hashtags tweeted by state.

### Problem

Twitter highlights daily trending topics with hashtags based on the user's perceived preferences or their chosen location. What if a twitter user wants to see how these national trends break down by state or region? There is currently no clear or efficient way to accomplish this.

### Solution

PoliTweets further breaks down national trending topics by allowing a user to see a hashtag's popularity by state with clear data visualization tools.

### Target Audience

Researchers, journalists, marketers, or simply political junkies on twitter.

### Integrations

* PoliTweets uses the Twitter REST API, integrates with Twitter OAuth, and uses the 'geocoder' gem to help find and normalize each Twitter user location
